## Overview

This repository hosts drivers specifically designed for the STM32F407xx microcontroller. It includes drivers for GPIOs, SPI, I2C and UART enabling seamless integration and interaction with these peripherals.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to facilitate learning and experimentation with microcontroller peripherals. By providing well-structured drivers for essential functionalities, developers can focus on understanding the intricacies of microcontroller programming without getting bogged down by peripheral configurations.

Many concepts and implementations are learnt from the exercises and lectures from the the course [Mastering Microcontroller with Peripheral Driver Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-microcontroller-with-peripheral-driver-development/learn/lecture/14265510#content).

## Usage

To utilize these drivers in your STM32F407xx projects, simply include the necessary files in your development environment and follow the provided documentation. Make sure to adhere to the licensing terms outlined in the repository.
